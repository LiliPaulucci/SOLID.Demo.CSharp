# SOLID.Demo.CSharp
A simple exercise to demonstrate some approaches like: Clean Code, TDD, SOLID and others.

This solution demonstrates how to apply TDD and SOLID, principle by principle. 

Problem: Receive an Arabic Number and answer with the Cardinal Number.
Ex.: Receive "4" and Return "Four"

The first folder is the TDD files.
The second folder is the JCC (Just Clean Code) files, that is a solution for the problem without using the SOLID principles.
The third folder is the same solution using SRP - Simple Responsability Principle.
The forth folder is the same solution using OCP - Open Closed Principle.
The fifth folder is the same solution using LSP - Liskov Substitution Principle.
The sixth folder is the same solution using ISP - Interface Segregation Principle.
The seventh folder is the same solution using DIP - Dependency Inversion Principle.
